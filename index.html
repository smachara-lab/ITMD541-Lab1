            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>
                I am Sowjanya, a graduate student at Illinois Tech, pursuing my Master's in Information Technology and Management with a specialization in Data Analytics. I have hands-on experience working as a Test Engineer at Infosys, where I specialized in automation testing with tools like Selenium and Katalon Studio. My expertise also spans across Agile methodologies, SQL, and data analytics.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I delve into the Web App Foundations course, I'm excited to expand my knowledge of dynamic web applications. This course will introduce key web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are essential for both client-side and server-side development. This will enable me to build functional and visually appealing web applications.

            <h2>My Web Development Experience:</h2>
            <p>
                Although my primary expertise lies in automation testing and data analytics, I have worked on several personal web development projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects have helped me understand the fundamental building blocks of modern web design and development.
            </p>
            <p>
                This class will allow me to further hone these skills, and I am looking forward to learning more about integrating server-side scripting with databases to create full-stack applications. My experience in working with databases like MySQL and tools like Power BI also gives me an analytical edge in data-driven web applications.
